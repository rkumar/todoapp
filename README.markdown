# todoapp

An unbelievably complex, multi-level command-line todo list manager.  
Based on bash.

    "I wrote this script as a way of not completing another, more pressing task."

     Deletes item and child items
     --force  does not prompt user

  mark | status TASK# <state>

     Listing of tasks
     list sub-options:
     --no-colors  - don't show colors
     --colors     - show colors  (default)
     --color-scheme priority  - show priorities in separate colors (default)
     --color-scheme status  - show statuses in separate colors
     --sort-serial  - sorts on task id rather than priority
     --hide-completed - do not list completed tasks
     --show-all - show all tasks (default)
     -P | --project <name> - show for this project only
     -C | --component <name> - show for this component only
     --hide-numbering - do not show numbers on left

  addsub TASK# [args]
     addsub TASK# text
        Add a subtask to the given item/subtask with given text
     addsub last text
        Adds text as a subtask under highest task (useful when adding from script)

  renumber TASK# TASK#
    Renumber a top level task to another (empty/deleted) number
