Subject: Version 2.0
--------------------

Changed structure, so subtasks are on a separate file.
Now file is hand-editable too.
Except for the starting TAB, maybe we can replace that with something.

Subject: Version 1.0
--------------------

First release of todoapp.
Contains one level of subtasks. However, subtasks are stored on same
line, so the file is not very hand-editable if subtasks are used.
